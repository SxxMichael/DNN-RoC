## Simulation Code
The files in the source code are the main Python files to conduct simulations for 4 different underlying functions ($f_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$). Example.py provides an example of how to run the code 
for sample size $n=3000$ based on the underlying function $f_3$. 

$P$ is the number of hidden units used in each layer of a deep ReLU network; $L$ is the number of layers.
